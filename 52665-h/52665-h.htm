Danube.”</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Ida</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Eva</span> <i>discovered waltzing,
introducing “The Boston Dip.” They waltz a few
moments, then stop. Music ceases.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Now, isn’t that delightful?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Delightful! It’s positively bewitching. Bless
that dear Monsieur Adonis. He deserves a crown of
roses for introducing to his assembly the latest Terpsichorean
novelty. O, we shall have a splendid time to-night!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Especially as those charming waltzers, Messrs.
Richard Dasher and Lavender Kids, “the glass of
fashion and the mould of form,” are to honor us with
their presence.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Yes, indeed. What would the dance be without
them?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Not worth the trouble of dressing. But don’t
you think that Mr. Dasher is a little too attentive to Miss
Eva Mulligrub,—eh, sister?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Not more attentive, certainly, than is Mr. Lavender
Kids to her charming sister, Miss Ida Mulligrub.—Eh,
sister?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But seriously, Eva, I begin to think that you
are carrying this matter a little too far. Mr. Dasher
might reasonably expect, from the partiality you unhesitatingly
show for his society, and the smiles you bestow
upon him, to be considered your lover.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> You begin to think. Why, bless you, Ida, I’ve
thought and thought and thought, for a long time, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>were I Mr. Lavender Kids, I should pop the question at
once, so undeniably entranced are you by his attentions.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Eva!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Ida!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> You’re talking nonsense.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Well, you began it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But you know you like Mr. Dasher.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> To be sure I do. He’s the best waltzer in the
city. Graceful, agreeable, and decidedly good-looking.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> And you would marry him?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Not unless he asked me, and then—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> And then—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> I should remember that he is considered a fortune-hunter,
that he is too fond of horses, that possibly
he might have an eye on father’s bank-book, that I don’t
want such a husband, and should very sweetly, calmly,
but decidedly say, No, thank you, Mr. Dasher.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Exactly what I should say to Mr. Kids, without
the sweetness and calmness.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> I hope we shall not have the chance, for then,
of course, we should lose their society—and they are
such superb waltzers.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But what in the world could have possessed
mother to have us come so early. Hurry, girls, hurry!
And here we are before the hall is lighted.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> I’m sure I don’t know. It’s one of her whims.
One would hardly think that, at her age, she would care
for dancing.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But she does. I caught her to-day attempting a
waltz before the glass in her room; and such work as she
did make of it!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span><i>Eva.</i> She’s not very nimble with her weight of years
and flesh, but she would come to-night, and without
father, too.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Catch him in such a place! No doubt he’s
already snoring at home in his easy-chair, speculating on
corner lots in his dreams.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Better that than the old life, dragging a handcart
through the streets, and shouting, “Cod! haddock!
halibut! eel—eel—eel—eels!”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Why, Eva, don’t speak of that; and such a
noise, too.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Who cares. Everybody knows what we once
were, and I, for one, am not going to be ashamed of father’s
old occupation. He has made money in an honest way:
so let us have no false pride, Ida. “Cod! haddock! halibut!
eel—eel—eel—eels!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Mulligrub, c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, I never! Eva Mulligrub, I’m blushing
with shame, petrified with mortification, and stunned
with grief, to hear such words as those proceeding from
your lips. I never heard such language before, never.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Why, mother! And I’ve heard father say those
very words brought you to the window many a time
when he passed; that they were the bait by which you
were caught, and that you were the best catch he ever
made.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Fiddle-de-de! That’s his twaddle. We’re
above such language now. But come, girls, fix me up!
I’m all coming to pieces. Is that what’s-its-name behind
all right, and this thingumbob on my neck, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>what-you-may-call-it on top of my head? Dear me, I’m all in
a pucker.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Everything about your dress is charming,
mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, I’m glad on’t. Now girls, look here,
I’ve made an assignment with Munseer What’s-his-name
to-night.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> A what?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Assignment? You mean an appointment.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, it’s all the same. I’m going to learn
to do that dipper thing, if I die for it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> I don’t understand.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> She means The Boston Dip.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> That’s it—where you go tipping about,
while the fiddlers play Struse’s Beautiful Blue Dan-<i>u</i>-by.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> You, mother, learn to waltz!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> And why not? There’s Mrs. What’s-her-name
gets through it, and she’s older and heavier than I.
I’m going to learn it. What’s the use of having money
if you can’t spin round like other folks. But don’t say a
word to your father. Bless me, how he would roar! But
he’s safe at home, snoozing in his chair by this time. I’ve
arranged it all. I’ve engaged this drawing-room for my
own party, and when you’re all dancing in the hall,
Muns<i>ee</i>r A—A—what’s-his-name will slip in here, and
practice the waltz with me, and nobody will know anything
about it until I’m deficient.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Proficient, mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, what’s the difference? It’s all arranged.
I’m not going to make a fool of myself before
folks when I can pay for private lessons.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher</i> (<i>loud</i>). Eureka!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>starting</i>). Good gracious! You what?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> “Fortune favors the brave.” Like Cæsar,
I came, I saw, and I’m overcome. May I come in?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Certainly, Mr. Dasher. Your presence always
adds a charm to our—what’s-its-name—circular.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Circle, mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Well, what’s the odds?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Thank you, Mrs. Mulligrub. You are arrayed
like an empress; Miss Ida, your costume is only
eclipsed by your charming face; Miss Eva—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> “Last but not least in our dear love,” must of
course be divine; so spare my blushes and your breath.
(<i>Sits on lounge</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>R.</span></span>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Thank you. And now congratulate me. I
threw down my pen, after a hard fight with figures, to
seek the lonely recesses of my bachelor’s quarters, heartily
sick of life, when it suddenly occurred to me that this
evening Monsieur Adonis gives one of his charming assemblies.
Perhaps, thought I, there I may find rest for
my weary brain from the figures of the ledger, which
are dancing in my head, in the figures of the dance. But
did I dream of falling into such charming society? No;
most emphatically and decidedly, no. Therefore, like
Cæsar—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> And pray, Mr. Dasher, who is this Cæsar
you’re making such a fuss about?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Why, mother!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> La, child, there’s nobody of that name I’m
acquainted with.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><i>Ida.</i> You know, mother, Cæsar was the great Roman
general, who—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> La, yes; Mr. Dasher was only speaking
metagorically. Cæsar was the man who crossed the
what’s-its-name, and was stabbed by a brute.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Never mind Cæsar. Here’s my card, Mr.
Dasher. Of course your name will be the first I shall
allow upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher</i> (<i>sits on lounge beside</i> <span class='sc'>Eva</span>). Am I to be so
highly honored. (<i>Takes card.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> For a waltz, and only one.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> La, child, don’t be so unscrupulous. You’ll
dance till you drop if you get a chance.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Hush, mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Now what’s the matter with you? Mr.
What’s-his-name will dance with you, too. Don’t be so
anxious.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> O, dear, was there ever such a torment. (<i>Sits
on lounge</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>L.</span></span>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids</i> (<i>with glass to his eye</i>). Now, weally! Have I
stumbled into the bodwaw of a bevy of enchanting goddesses?—have
I, weally?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> O, Mr. Kids!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> You have, weally, Mr. Kids.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Lavender, my boy, how are you?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> And will the divine goddesses permit me to
entaw, to disturb their tableaw of beauty with my horwid
figgaw?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Yes, trot your horwid figgaw in, Mr. Kids.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Eva, I’m astonished at such language as
those. Mr. Kids, we are delighted to see you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><i>Ida.</i> Yes, indeed, Mr. Kids. I’ve kept my card for
you.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Divine creachaw, you overpowaw me—you do,
weally. (<i>Sits on lounge beside</i> <span class='sc'>Ida</span>, <i>and takes her card.</i>)
Just one waltz?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> As many as you please, Mr. Kids.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> Now that’s what I call generous. I wonder
where Mr.—no, Muns<i>ee</i>r—Adonis can be. (<i>Retires
up.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Mr. Dasher, how can you tell such falsehoods,
when you know, that I know, that you know, we were to
be here to-night.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> What a knowing young lady. It’s one of
the frailties of masculine nature, Miss Eva. I’m glad I
was not George Washington, for I should certainly have
spoiled that hatchet story by a lie. Now I am here,
dear Miss Eva, overpowered with the burden of a
weighty secret, I am going to disclose it. I—I—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> I say, Dashaw, I’ve had my bwains surveyed
to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Have you? I didn’t know you had any.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Yaas, several. Destwuctiveness, combativeness,
idolitwy—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Ideality.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Yaas, it’s vewry wemarkable how those phwenological
fellaws lay out your bwains, and name them just
like—aw—stweets.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher</i> (<i>aside</i>). They must have labeled some of
yours “No Thoroughfare.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> O, don’t talk about brains, Mr. Kids. The
discussion of such a subject might fly to your head.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span><i>Dasher.</i> And so light is the material there, cause a
conflagration.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Yaas, yaas, like a Mansard woof. And, Dashaw,
I’ve got a diwectory of my bwains, and it’s deucedly
clevaw; for if an ideah gets into my bwains, I can trace
it out in the diwectory, and tell just where it lies, you
know, and know just where to find it. Deuced clevaw.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher</i> (<i>aside</i>). ’Twould die of starvation before you
found it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Miss Eva, I must have an interview with
you this evening. I have much to say. Meet me here
in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Certainly. I’ll slip away at the first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Thank you. The first dance is mine, you
remember.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Aw, Miss Ida, I must speak with you alone; I
must, weally. There’s something on my bwain—no—on
my bweast, that must be welieved. Don’t go. Stay
behind with me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> And lose the first dance?—No, indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Weally, I couldn’t ask that. Couldn’t you contwive
to meet me here alone?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> At the first opportunity. I’ll do my best.
(<i>Rises.</i>) Eva, one moment.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva</i> (<i>rises and comes,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>). Well, dear?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Don’t you think, Mr. Kids wants me to meet
him here alone.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Does he? The same thought must have wandered
into his bwain that crept into Mr. Dasher’s, for he
expects me to meet him here alone.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Do you know what it all means?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Certainly—proposals.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> And will you permit Mr. Dasher—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> No, indeed. Marry that fickle thing? Never!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Exactly my mind. Mr. Kid’s a fool.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span><i>Eva.</i> But, like Mr. Dasher, a splendid waltzer. We
cannot afford to lose them.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Indeed we cannot. Partners are so scarce.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> They want father’s money.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But they must not have his daughters.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> No, indeed. You watch me, and I’ll watch
you, and there’ll be no proposals. (<i>Retire to</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>R.</span></span> <i>and</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>L.</span></span>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> And you got my note, Munseer Adonis?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mons. A.</i> Ah, madam, I have it next my heart. (<i>Produces

Hannah Mulligrub.” Zat is all it say.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> But you know what it means. I am anxious
to learn “The Boston Dip.” Were I to come to your
school I should be laughed at, but here, while the company
are waltzing, no one would know it, and the inspiring
music would aid me. I don’t want to make a fool
of myself, you understand.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mons. A.</i> Certainly. All zat I shall remember. I
have written on ze back of ze note “Boston Dip.” I put
him in ze pocket wiz my handkerchief, so zat when I
pull him out to wipe my face ze note will arrest my attention,
and I shall fly to you, madam. (<i>Puts note and

<p class='c011'><i>Mrs. M.</i> O, you Frenchmen are so inveterate.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Come, Monsieur Adonis, the dance, the

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span><i>Kids.</i> Weally, the delay is vexatious; it is, weally.

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mulligrub, c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> So, so, here we are, Mrs. Mulligrub, unexpectedly,
and no doubt unwelcome. You imagine
the old codger snoozing away at home, but here he
is, and wide awake too. It’s about time the head of
the house knew what is going on. And here’s where the
money goes. Well, who cares? There’s lots of it, so
let it fly. But I’ve a wonderful curiosity to know how
my Hannah carries herself among all these fine snobs,
so I’m bound to have a peep. (<i>Goes towards door</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>R.</span></span>
<i>Sees note on carpet.</i>) Hallo! what’s this? a billy-deux?
(<i>Picking it up.</i>) Where’s my specs? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Meet
me”—ho, ho! here’s a nice little plot—(<i>reads</i>)—“in
the private drawing-room”—that’s here—(<i>reads</i>)—“while
the company are waltzing. Do not fail me.
Hannah Mulligrub.” My wife! Ye gods and little
fishes! my wife. “Do not fail me.” Is this the reward
of my generosity? My wife! What does it mean?
Who is the scoundrel that is tampering with the affections
of Hannah, and the peace of Moses Mulligrub?
(<i>Turns note over.</i>) “Boston Dip.” Who’s he? “Boston
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Dip.” There’s a name. I’ve heard of the “Manchester
Pet,” and the “Dublin Baby,” but the “Boston
Dip,”—confound him, let me get hold of him, and I’ll
Christen him with a dip that will drown him. Here’s
nice goings on! A respectable wife, and a mother, too,
making an appointment with an individual bearing such
a name as that—“Boston Dip.” He shall not fail you,
Mrs. M., but he must meet me too. I’ll not stir from
this place until I know what this means. This comes of
letting women roam abroad when they should be kept at
home. O, Mrs. Mulligrub! if I don’t cut down your pin
money for this my name’s not Moses Mulligrub. I’ll not
leave you a pin to stand on. (<i>Takes chair; slams it
down,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>) “Boston Dip.” (<i>Sits, and jumps up.</i>) Gracious!
he must be a sparrer, and that’s his fighting
name. No matter, let him come on. (<i>Sparring.</i>) The
old man’s a little out of practice, but he’s game. (<i>Sits;
folds his arms.</i>) If this little party does not end in a
shindy, it won’t be my fault.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dasher</span> <i>backs in,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>R.</span></span>, <i>waving his handkerchief.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Does she mean to come? I cannot attract
her attention. (<i>Backs up still, waving his handkerchief.</i>)
Why don’t she come? (<i>Backs against</i> <span class='sc'>Mulligrub’s</span>
<i>chair, sending it over, and</i> <span class='sc'>Mulligrub</span> <i>on to the floor.</i>)
I beg your pardon.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>picking himself up</i>). Sir!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> I really beg your pardon. Did you break
anything?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> No, sir; but I shall presently break the
peace and your head.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span><i>Dasher.</i> I beg you won’t do anything of the kind. It
was an accident; and besides, you are trespassing here.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> O, I am! And pray, sir, will you be kind
enough to explain the meaning of that remark?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Certainly. This is Mrs. Mulligrub’s private
drawing-room, where none but her friends are allowed
to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Indeed! (<i>Aside.</i>) This must be “Dip.”
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, sir, I am one of her friends—a particular
friend.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> I see: an old friend of the family. You’re
just the man I want to see. Yes, sir, the moment I set
eyes on you I said to myself, “There’s a man who can
serve me.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Indeed—(<i>aside</i>) with a broken head.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Yes, sir. You know old Mulligrub?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Old Mulligrub! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Intimately.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Good. I’ve never seen him, but people say
he’s immensely rich. What do you say? Will he cut up
well?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). “Cut up!” Confound his impudence.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> I’ve particular reasons for wishing to know.
I may say, I am very much attached to a member of his
family, you understand. I’m not mercenary; but you
know times are hard, and to make a respectable show in
society, have a nice house, a half dozen fast horses, and
all that sort of thing, requires money. Now, what I
want to know is this, will the old man shell out?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Shell out? Look here, young man, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>coolness you certainly would take the premium at the
largest display of frozen wares in Alaska. If I don’t
answer your polite questions, it is because your audacity
has so astounded me, that, hang me, if I know whether
there is an old Mulligrub to “cut up” or “shell out” at
all. (<i>Aside.</i>) It must certainly be “Dip.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> O, you won’t tell. Hush! there’s somebody
coming—somebody who I am particularly anxious to
meet alone, you understand. Just step out of that door
(<i>pointing,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>), that’s a good fellow.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Sir, I shall do nothing of the kind.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> But you must—only for a moment, and then
you shall return. (<i>Pushes him back.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Sir, do you know who I am?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Certainly; a friend of the family; and, as a
friend of the family, when the time comes you shall know
all. Now go, that’s a good fellow. (<i>Pushes him back to
door,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> But, sir, I shall not. (<i>Aside.</i>) Stop.
I’ll watch. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Very well, sir; as I seem to be in
the way, I will retire.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> I knew you would—you’re such a good
fellow.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Good fellow! (<i>Aside.</i>) Confound his
impudence.</p>

<div class='c012'>[<i>Exit,</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span></div>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Ha, ha! Got rid of him. (<i>Comes down stage.</i>
<span class='sc'>Mulligrub</span> <i>enters</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>, <i>and steps behind screen.</i>) Now for
a tender interview with Miss Eva, ending in a proposal,
which I know she will accept. (<i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Eva, c.</span>) I knew
you would come.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Because I promised. O, Mr. Dasher, that
waltz was delightful.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span><i>Dasher.</i> Indeed! I am glad you enjoyed it. If it
gave you pleasure I should be satisfied, though my heart
is heavy, and the waltz had little inspiration for me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Dear me, Mr. Dasher, you look as melancholy
as an owl. What has gone wrong?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Nothing—everything—Miss Eva. I am
on the verge of a precipice, a frightful precipice. (<span class='sc'>Mulligrub’s</span>
<i>head appears above screen</i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). There’s “Dip” and—Eva, as I
live!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> I don’t understand you, Mr. Dasher.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Upon the verge of a frightful precipice I totter.
Beneath me are the whitened bones of many a mortal.
If I fall not a tear will be shed for me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Nary a tear, young man.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> ’Tis the valley of disappointed hopes.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Dip’s getting grave.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Into this must I fall, unless the succoring
hand be stretched forth to me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). The sucker!</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> You, Miss Eva, you—admirable, divine,
angelic—can stretch forth that hand to save Dasher
from dashing himself into the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Mr. Dasher, have you been drinking?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Draughts of bliss from the fountain of love:
basking in the sunshine of your presence. O, Miss Eva,
will you save me?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Eva.</i> Once again, Mr. Dasher, I tell you I do not understand
you.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). ’Twould puzzle a Dutchman.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Have I then been mistaken? have those little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>delicate attentions which I fondly imagined were gaining
for me a corner on your heart—ah, I mean in your
heart—been wasted on the desert air?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Dip’s getting airy.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> On the brink of a precipice I stand—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). On the rocks again, Dip.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> Can you see me rush headlong to ruin, angelic
Eva.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Dip’s getting high—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher.</i> You are the star of my destiny; you are the
prize for which I strive, you are the divinity of my adoration.
Here on my knees—(<i>Falls on his knees</i> <span class='small'><span class='fss'>L.</span></span> <i>of</i>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Don’t stop to talk. Come quick! quick! (<i>Drags

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Ha, ha! Dip’s left on the brink
again.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Dasher</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). Confound that girl! I’ve lost
the chance. This comes of making a long story about a
very short question. The precipice was a failure. I’ll
go and pump the friend of the family. (<i>Exit</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span> <span class='sc'>Mulligrub</span>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> That can’t be Dip, after all. He’s after
Eva. But he can’t have her. Thanks to his confidential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>assurance, I can send him over the precipice into
the valley of disappointed hopes in short order.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Now weally, I saw Miss Ida enter this woom,
positively saw her, and now she’s gone. Hallo! an intrudaw.
Sir, I have not the honow of your acquaintance.
This woom is the wesort, the westing-place of a bevy of
divine goddesses. No masculine mortals are allowed to
entaw here.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> Show! then you are not a masculine mortal,
I take it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Sir, you are impertinent. I am—I am a particular
fwiend of the lady who is the lawful possessor of
this wesort.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Can this be Dip? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Sir,
I am a particular friend of the lady in question, being the
brother of her husband’s brother.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Weally, the bwover of her husband’s bwover.
Pon honow, that’s a sort of cwoss-eyed welation.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> What do you mean by that? Do you
doubt my right to be here?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Hey? wight?—no, no. (<i>Aside.</i>) He must

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> I say, would it be a good inwestment to wun
away with a membaw of his family?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). It must be Dip. Shall I mash
him? No, no, the proof first. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Splendid!
Can I help you?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span><i>Kids.</i> Well, I don’t know. He’s a wough specimen,
and he so vulgaw. Sold fish in a handcart, too. I detest
fish, it’s on such a low scale. Now isn’t that good?
It’s owiginal, too. I don’t like the odaw. Dreadful low
people, but then, there’s lots of money. Yaas, I think I
will sacwafice myself.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). I’ll sacrifice you, you monkey.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) But tell me, who is the favored member of the
family?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Hush! somebody’s coming. You must wetire.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> What, and lose the fun? No, I thank
you.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> You must, weally. The lady is coming. It
would shock her delicate nerves were you to be pwesent
at the interview. So go, that’s a dear fellah. (<i>Pushes
him back</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>)</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). He calls me a good fellah. Shall
I fell him on the spot? No, I’ll wait; vengeance can
afford to wait.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Do wetire, and, when it’s all ovaw, I will call
you. (<i>Pushes him back</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>) Good fellah.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub.</i> You’ll call me when it’s all over. (<i>Aside.</i>)
I’ll be on hand while it’s going on.</p>

husband—no, that ain’t it, it’s the bwover’s wife’s husband—no,
or—(<i>Mulligrub enters</i>, <span class='small'><span class='fss'>C.</span></span>, <i>and gets behind

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Here I am, Mr. Kids, to fulfill my promise.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Yaas, Miss Ida, like the bounding fawn that—that—weally,
I forget what the bounding fawn was
doing—O, weally, bounding, of course. That’s very
good—isn’t it?—owiginal, too. But where was the
bounding fawn bound? that’s the question.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> I wish I could answer your question, but, not
being versed in natural history, I am unable to say.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Weally. Well, never mind the fawn. Listen,
O, listen! I’m a miserable wetch, I am.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Miserable? you?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids</i>. Yaas, weally. I’m standing—I’m standing,—where

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>sticking his head above screen</i>). Hallo!
another brink, another precipice, and—Ida, as I live.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> La, Mr. Kids, what a dangerous position.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Kids; then it’s not Dip, that’s certain.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> O, dweadful, dweadful. But you can save me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> How, Mr. Kids?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> That’s the ideah, Miss Ida; for when a fellah
is on the bwink of such a pwecipice, as the pwecipice I
am on the bwink of, the best way to save him is to push
him ovaw.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> Well, that’s certainly an original idea.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> Yaas, it is an owiginal, idea—mine, too—I
found it in my bwain, with the help of the diwectory.
When a fellah’s on the bwink of matwimony, of course
his safety and his happiness is secured by his being
pushed into it. You see my ideah.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Deuced clumsy one.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ida.</i> But how can I help you?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids.</i> By pushing me ovaw. Miss Ida, you are bewitching,
you are lovely, you are divine, and on my

<p class='c011'><i>Mulligrub</i> (<i>aside</i>). Won’t somebody be kind enough
to remove that precipice?</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Kids</i> (<i>rising</i>). Yaas, weally, that owiginal ideah
will kill me, I know it will. I must go and bathe my

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
